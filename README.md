## Prelude
AI will undoubtedly change the world in unimaginable ways with the rate at the technology is being developed and explored. There are two main tenets to capitalism that have brought the technology to where it is currently and will continue to allow for its increased focus and growth: 

- competition
- incentive

With that in mind, the underlying movement behind this technology needs to be explored and scrutinized thoroughly. Additionally, the increased focus on how the tools will affect the younger generation needs to be studied. Younger people are those who are most affected by this growth while having the least amount of influence in the development and representation behind the policies which mandate its future.
